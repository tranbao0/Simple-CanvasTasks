 * The clock of the extension service worker.

 * clock to a fixed instant, and the week, the past-due cut and the stale time then do not depend
 * on the day the test runs. The clock keeps running at real speed from that instant, so timers
 * such as the 5-second undo window still pass in real time.
 *
 * Pages and content scripts keep the real clock. They use it only for the midnight timer.
