# Test fixtures

These fixtures give tests one realistic Canvas student and a set of fake Canvas pages.
The JSON shapes follow the canvas-lms serializers at commit 1c9f0bb, with string ids.
Nothing here reads the real clock or the network.

## scenario.ts

`buildScenario(now)` returns every Canvas response for one student, Jordan Rivera, with dates relative to `now`.
Dates fall on local days in America/New_York, so "due tomorrow at 11:59 pm" stays true for any `now`.
Fields that Canvas computes, such as `missing`, `late`, `locked_for_user` and `availability_status`, follow the Canvas rules at `now`.
`SCENARIO` is the frozen scenario at `SCENARIO_NOW`, Tuesday 2026-10-27 at 2 pm EDT.
Its current week runs from Sunday Oct 25 to Saturday Oct 31, and daylight saving time ends on Sunday Nov 1.
`IDS` names every id by its meaning, for example `IDS.assignments.mathHomework5`.
Call `buildScenario(now)` for a fresh copy that a test may change.

## What the scenario covers

- Six courses: biology, calculus, history (nickname and checkpoints), chemistry (no color), orientation (2023 term start) and a club that the student hides.
- One course group in chemistry and one account group whose id is larger than 2^53.
- Canvas uploads, classic graded quizzes, New Quizzes, Gradescope work, on-paper labs and no-submission columns.
- A graded discussion, two checkpointed discussions as `sub_assignment` rows, ungraded discussions and pages with a to-do date.
- Peer reviews of both kinds: `assessment_request` rows and a `peer_review_sub_assignment` row.
- Custom tasks with and without a course, and calendar events and announcements that the extension drops.
- An extension, a teacher status, a redo request after a done mark on Canvas and on Gradescope, and a teacher-set Missing on Gradescope.
- A locked item, a locked missing item, a Gradescope item past its lock date and an excused item.
- A skipped past-due item, a skipped undated item and a module "Mark as done" override with both flags true.
- An item due at 00:00 on the first day of the next week, and an item before the orientation course's 16-week horizon.

## plannerItemsInRange and the planner range

`SCENARIO.plannerItems` holds every planner row from 400 days ago to the end of the fall term.
`plannerItemsInRange(scenario, range)` answers one `GET /api/v1/planner/items` request, with both ends included.
Older-style peer reviews match on the reviewer's own due date, which `plannerRangeDates` records, as Canvas does.

## Assignment lists

`SCENARIO.assignments` answers the assignment details request, `assignment_ids[]` with `include[]=submission`, when you filter it by id.
`SCENARIO.undatedAssignments` answers the undated request, which also sends `include[]=checkpoints` and `exclude_checkpoints=true`.
Every course is in one account that has discussion checkpoints turned on, so each undated assignment has `has_sub_assignments` and `checkpoints`.
History's undated list still holds its two checkpoint parents, as a server that ignores `exclude_checkpoints` returns them.
`allAssignmentsInCourse(scenario, courseId)` answers the planner-off request, `include[]=submission&include[]=checkpoints`, with the checkpoint fields on every assignment.

## scenario.snapshot.json

This file is `SCENARIO` as JSON, checked by `tests/unit/fixtures.test.ts`.
It lets a reader see every exact value without running code.
After a deliberate change to the scenario, run `npx vitest run tests/unit/fixtures.test.ts -u` to write it again.

## wire-types.ts

These types extend the shared contract types with every field that Canvas really sends.
A fixture value of a wire type is assignable to the matching contract type.

## canvas-json.ts

These builders turn short specs into exact Canvas JSON.
They copy the Canvas rules for `missing`, `late`, `graded`, html_url, lock info and override types.

## time.ts

These helpers compute local days and Canvas-style instants from one given `now`.

## errors.ts

`CANVAS_ERRORS` holds exact Canvas error responses: signed out, Limited Access, the 403 and 429 throttle, a duplicate override, 404 and 500.
`invalidAssignmentIds(ids)` builds the 400 that Canvas sends when one id is not an assignment.
`NOT_CANVAS_RESPONSES` holds answers from a site that is not Canvas, for the setup check.

## pages.ts

`FIXTURE_PAGES` lists each page with the URL to serve it at and what the in-page adapter must do there.
`fixturePagePath(page)` gives the file path for a route handler.

## pages/

Each Canvas page has `#application.ic-app`, an inline script that sets `INST` and `ENV`, and Canvas's column layout.
At 992 px and wider, the right column is 288 px wide with 240 px of content; below that it stacks under the content.
Canvas fills parts of a page after load, so each page replays those steps from `template[data-fixture-step]` elements.
Wait for `html[data-fixture-ready="true"]` before you assert, or add `?fixture_delay_ms=0` to the URL.
The pages load no other files, and each page sets an empty favicon so the browser requests nothing.

### dashboard-card-view.html

The classic Card View dashboard at `/`, with `with-right-side` on the body.
After load, `#right-side` gets the student To Do, Coming Up, Recent Feedback and View Grades.
Canvas shows Coming Up next to the student To Do only for some roles and flags, and this page includes it so a test can check that it stays visible.

### dashboard-recent-activity.html

The Recent Activity dashboard at `/`, with the stream in `#dashboard-activity`.
Its right side has the student To Do, Recent Feedback and View Grades, which is the real student layout.

### dashboard-list-view.html

The List View dashboard at `/`, with the planner and `#dashboard-planner-header`.
The body has no `with-right-side`, `#right-side-wrapper` has `display: none` and `#right-side` is empty.
The extension must inject nothing here.

### dashboard-widgets.html

The widget dashboard at `/`, which renders into `#content` with `data-testid="widget-columns"`.
The body has no `with-right-side` and `#right-side` is empty.
The extension must inject nothing here.

### dashboard-mixed-role.html

The dashboard at `/` for a student who is also a TA.
Its right side has the legacy teacher To Do (`h2.todo-list-header` and `ul.to-do-list`), Coming Up and Recent Feedback, and no `.Sidebar__TodoListContainer`.
The list mounts above the teacher To Do, which stays visible.

### course-home.html

The biology course home at `/courses/101`, with the course navigation open.
Its right side has the course buttons, the course To Do in `.todo-list.Sidebar__TodoListContainer` and Recent Feedback.

### course-home-hidden-course.html

The home page of the club course at `/courses/106`, which the scenario student hides.
The list shows a one-line note with a settings link here instead of the list.

### course-home-k5.html

A K-5 subject course home at `/courses/107`, which is not in the scenario.
It has no right column, so the extension must inject nothing here.

### not-canvas.html

A university news page to serve at `https://news.northfield.edu/`.
It has `with-right-side` on the body and a `#right-side` with a `.todo-list-header`, but no `#application.ic-app` and no `ENV`.
Canvas detection must not accept it.
