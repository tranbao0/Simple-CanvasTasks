/**
 * The refresh policy. See docs/design.md, decision 11, "Refresh triggers".
 *
 * - A "Canvas page loaded" message, a window that gains focus, or the browser start refreshes
 *   the planner items only (a light round).
 * - The 5-minute timer refreshes everything (a full round). Every visible surface runs its own
 *   timer, so a timer tick runs a full round only when the last one is about 5 minutes old.
 * - A surface that starts or becomes visible again asks for a full round when the last one is
 *   older than 5 minutes, otherwise for a light round.
 * - At most one round runs per 60 seconds. A full request that comes within 60 seconds of a
 *   light round runs when the 60 seconds end. Writes, address changes and Retry skip the limit.
